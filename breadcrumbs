This component creates a ``breadcrumb'' list that can be used in
HTML::Mason sites.  It specifies various CSS hooks for styling.

Use:

Put

   <& breadcrumbs &>

in your autohandler file and a breadcrumb list will appear in the
rendered page.

The list is formatted as

   <ul id="breadcrumbs">
   <li class="first"><a href="http://www.my.domain/">Home</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www.my.domain/topdir/">topdir</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www.my.domain/topdir/subdir1/">subdir1</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www.my.domain/topdir/subdir1/subdir2/">subdir2</a></li>
   </ul>
