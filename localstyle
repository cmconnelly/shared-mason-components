This component inserts the contents of a localstyle method into the
page, if one exists.  It is used in the header of the document (in
the autohandler), generally as

   <& /localstyle &>


By default, the <style> tag will specify the
screen media type, but the media type can be specified with an
argument of the form 

   <& /localstyle, 'print', Media=>'print' &>
